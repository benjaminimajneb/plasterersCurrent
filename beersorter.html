		The idea is to provide a parser for text lists of beers.  Copy and paste a list of beer names (with the brewery, obv), 
		and it will use data generated by users of online websites such as untappd to return a list of matched beers, in order
		of popularity (either by number of ratings, or overall rating).
		<br />
		The hope is that it will be useful for guiding where to go at a beer festival, or choosing which beers to buy from a list of available options.
