					<h2> Preamble: </h2>				

	<h3> Introduction</h3>
	<p>
We are a small pub in the middle of a residential area and whilst we have duty to provide a high quality and thriving venue for those within our community, we also have a responsibility to minimise the impact of those who live close to us but do not wish to engage with us.  We must do all we can to reduce noise output and any litter or obstructions to the highway around us.
	</p>

	<h3> Issues </h3>
	<p>
Unfortunately due to there being no outside area of the pub which we can designate for smokers, it is necessary that at all times of operation, customers may be standing on the pavements outside the pub.  Therefore we need to ensure their safety and ensure their impact on local residents is kept to a minimum.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Being a Victorian building, with no outside space and only shared outside walls or walls facing the pavement, there is nowhere for an extraction unit for air conditioning to be installed.  Therefore during the summer months it is essential for the windows and doors of the pub to be opened to ensure the safety of customers and staff.  Given this we need to actively ensure the escape of sound from the venue is limited.
</p>


	<h2> &nbsp;</h2>
	<h2> Policy: </h2>

<h3> 1) Customers Outside </h3>
<p>
During service, staff need to be aware of customers they are serving, and watching those customers who leave the building to smoke.  Staff must regularly (and certainly no less frequently than 30min intervals) walk around the outside of the pub during service to ensure that:
</p><br>
	<ol>
		<li> Customers outside the venue must be off the road at all times.</li>
		<li> Customers are behaving in a quiet and orderly way.</li>
		<li> Customers should be encouraged not to remain outside when they are not smoking.</li>
		<li> No empty glasses are left on window-sills and pavements.</li>
		<li> Our licence states that no drinks may be taken outside after 10:30.   We have voluntarily reduced this to 10pm.  This is strict and non-negotiable.</li>
	</ol>
<br>
<p>
<i>Any customers seen to be in breach of these items must be dealt with <b> immediately.</b> </i>
</p>

<h3>2) Music </h3>
<p>
A balance must be struck between temperature regulation and noise emissions from the pub.   For the purposes of this policy, live music refers to any form of performance (bands, artists, instruments, playing records) which is amplified.  Ancillary music is that which is played through the hi-fi unit behind the bar.
</p>
<br>
	<ol>
		<li> Staff must ensure that the small stand-alone air conditioning unit is switched on during service and venting through the side window.</li>
		<li> Whenever the temperature of the pub allows, the front door and windows should be kept shut.</li>
		<li> Ancillary music must not be turned up above the level marked on the front of the hi-fi amp.</li>
		<li> Whenever live music  occurs the front door and windows MUST be kept shut.  Customers should be encouraged to use the side door.</li>
		<li> Whenever live music  occurs customers should be encouraged to only use the side door to smoke, not the front door. </li>
		<li> Any time live music occurs, the sound levels emitted must be measured and recorded at specified points around the outside venue.  If sound levels reach above 80dBA at either point, the output must be reduced immediately, or the music stopped.</li>
		<li> Our licence states that we can play live music until 11pm, we have voluntarily reduced this to 10:30pm.  This is strict and non-negotiable.</li>
		<li> No ancillary music is to be played after time is called at the bar.</li>
	</ol>


<h3>3) Miscellaneous </h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Bottles and rubbish glass must only be emptied into the large outside bin in the morning after 10am.</li>
		<li>Cigarette bins must be emptied weekly, and the pavement outside the pub swept daily.</li>
	</ol>

<h3>Further Actions: </h3>
<p>
The management will continue to review this policy in light of our performance and any feedback we receive.  Staff will continue to be trained regularly to ensure that this policy is adhered to. Further to this, the following actions are already in progress:
<br></p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Whilst live bands are an integral part of the culture of the community and have been absolutely key to the sustainability of our business, we have recently encouraged a shift towards live music in the form of DJs and record only nights.  
	These are quieter and easier to control the sound of and as such this trend will continue wherever possible.
	</li>
	<li>
	As part of the recent refurbishment of the inside of the pub, clear signs have been installed detailing our licensing conditions and requesting the cooperation of customers in these.
	Over the early part of summer 2017 further signs will be installed around both the inside and outside of both entrances to the pub.
	</li>
</ul>


	<h2> &nbsp;</h2>
	<h2> Summary:</h2>
<p>
The style of the pub is defined by products that reflect the pinnacle of quality and independent craftsmanship that is available in the UK, and excellent customer service is paramount to everything that we do.  We actively encourage responsible drinking and progressive behaviour in all of our customers.  We should be careful to extend this to the type and manner in which music is played in the venue.  
â€¨We are careful about, and are actively reducing the energy impact of the business and the amount of non-biodegradable or recyclable waste from the business, and we should be equally careful to minimise the impact we have on the local environment and our neighbours.
</p>
