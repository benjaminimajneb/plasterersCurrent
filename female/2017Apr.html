<p>
FEM.ALE is a festival that showcases female led music and most importantly, beer brewed by women and enjoyed by everyone.
Surprisingly, FEM.ALE is the first dedicated brewster festival in the U.K providing a platform to celebrate women in the beer industry through 
extensive lists of female brewed beer, meet-the-brewers, specially made one-off ales, panels, discussions and all sorts of other events.
</p>	
<p>We get asked a few questions on a regular basis – sometimes from people with genuine inquiries or wanting clarification, 
sometimes from people being snarky because… well, that’s what you get for pointing out gender inequality. 
</p>

<h4> What counts as a Brewster beer? </h4>
<p>
All the beers at FEM.ALE are designed, developed and brewed by women or brew teams that are led by women. Most of the breweries we source from are pretty small, so it’s easy to define who’s doing the brewing, as opposed to other jobs such as the accounts or the marketing. At some of the bigger beer companies, it’s harder to tell who’s at the heart of the physical brewing process and the creative design process, so we go to the women in those organisations and ask them what beers they’ve been involved with or which they would recommend in the line-up of beers at the brew co. they work at. 
</p>

<h4> What’s the difference between ‘craft beer’ and ‘real ale’?  </h4>
<p>
Technically, not a lot. Or at least it depends on where you are. As a cultural phenomenon, craft beer emerged out of smaller batch American breweries in the 1990s and 2000s, Sierra Nevada being a brand that used ‘craftiness’ to offer an alternative beer identity to those at big beer co’s like Coors or Budweiser to huge commercial success. Here in the UK, thanks to CAMRA and the tireless work of thousands of brewers creating quality small batch beer, real ale breweries were always sort of…doing that anyway. 
However, while the American term ‘craft’ refers to the smaller volume of beer being produced, over here ‘craft’ refers more to the style. ‘Craft beer’ is often keg bound than barrel aged, is therefore fizzier and stronger American hops are used, giving American style craft beers a different, more pronounced hop flavour than ‘real ale’ does with our slightly less sun-drenched British-grown hops. Rain cloud emoji. 
</p>
<h4> Where are all the women in cider-making?? </h4>
<p>
We’re working on it! 
</p>

<h4> Are men allowed at the festival (hurr hurr)? </h4>
<p>
Yes (hurr hurr). We welcome all genders to the party. 
</p>

<h4> Is the beer… different? </h4>
<p>
Different… to what? If you’re a regular beer drinker, you’re probably already drinking Brewster beers on a regular basis. 

Our plan is to bring a selection of them together to celebrate women in an industry where we are largely underrepresented. 
</p>
					
<!-- 
<p> 

Sourcing an extensively rich collection of ales, lagers, stouts, porters, and saisons

from female-led breweries across the UK and beyond, FEM.ALE is gearing up to

showcase four days of brewster beers on tap for all to enjoy. 

Prominently featured is

the Unite Local Ale. Brewed on International Women’s Day, the Unite Local Ale is

the result of 70 breweries around the world – including the FEM.ALE team – working

together on International Women’s Collaboration Brew Day to make a unique ale.

Punters can also be sure to expect more limited commissioned brews created by

expert beer technologists. 


Surprisingly, FEM.ALE is the first dedicated brewster festival in the U.K providing a

platform to celebrate women in the beer industry, “Women are still being left out of

the conversation. Despite all the successes – the vibrant networks of brewsters, the

collaborations, the dialogues reinventing stereotypical narratives, the revival of the

forgotten history of women in brewing – we still know that we'll run into all sorts of

negative, oversimplified images of women from brewers and trade institutions alike

who are abhorrently leaving women out of the discussion. And that's why FEM.ALE

must exist, to bring women to the forefront of that conversation. When they're not too

busy making outstanding beer, of course” said Erica Horton, FEM.ALE Director.


But it’s not just about serving great beer, FEM.ALE is getting book smart by hosting

free-to-attend debate panels. Beer experts, brewsters, authors and historians will

share documented research about the brewing industry, including insight into the

connection between women and beer throughout the history of human booze-
making. Helen Warner from the University of East Anglia and Sam Goodman from

Bournemouth University will discuss their examination of craft beer history.

The ever popular ‘Meet the Brewster’ beer tastings and food matchings return, as will

live local female-led music, including DJs.

Attending the Festival is free but on a first come, first served basis. Come early to

avoid disappointment.

<h4>✪ SATURDAY 27th - 2PM ✪</h4>
<h5>PANEL DISCUSSION</h5>
<p>
We know no one's really sick of experts! Chaired by festival director Erica Horton, The Plasterers welcomes academics from UEA, Bournemouth and Leicester to share their research on craft work, histories of beer and how the industry is working today to diversify its work force. 
Sam Goodman joins us to discuss his research on beer and colonialism and the ways in which discourses of British entrepreneurship and Empire still appear in craft beer branding today. 
Helen Warner shares her research into gender and craft work and questions why, when women are increasingly moving into 'craft' industries and self employment, microbrewing and the rise of the craft beer industry has seen a continued male gendered identity. 
Chris Land and Scott Taylor will present some of their work on the craft beer industry and the ways in which discourses around gender in advertising and in the industry itself creates disparity in the labour force. Theyve interviewed all sorts of people working in beer - including us!
As well as sharing academic research, we welcome all our local beer experts and brewers to take part in an interactive Q&A, where you can explore our speakers' thoughts further, and make your own voices heard in the conversation using your own experiences of beer and pub culture.

					<div class='textContent'>
					
<p>
Last year was a total fun fest so we're scooting down to Brighton from our home town of Norwich once again, with all the best beers and some more musical buddies in tow. 
Oh and all our events are free. I know, right?!
</p>
<h4>✪ FRIDAY ✪   </h4>
<p>
We're kicking off the weekend with all the best brewster beers and Emma Inch from Fermentation Radio Show spinning some rockabilly vibes for your listening pleasure. 
</p>
<h4>✪ SATURDAY ✪   </h4>
<p>
Did someone say all day street party?! YES IT WAS US. 
We're shutting down the street outside the Marly to bring you live music, stalls and outisde beer drinking facilities, and vegan food. Compered by the wonderful Emma Frankland. 

We're bringing Norwich two piece Sink Ya Teeth with their bassy beats and poetic vocals and London based The Nyx will be bringing their patriarchy smashing rock noises. 
Plus Brighton based megababe I Am Fya - dark Basslines and sexed up vocals to make your knees go weak!
Dancing is advised.

Browse the stalls and enjoy (fingers crossed) the sunshine while trying a huge range of brewster beers - from midday til six!
</p>
<h4>✪ SATURDAY NIGHT ✪  </h4>

<p>
UH OH SPAGHETTI OHS. We're very pleased to add BOSSY Brighton to our weekend of entertainment. After the street party we'll move the tunes back inside as BOSSY kick off a dance party of "the best tracks of the 90s to 2000s R&B. Nothing but throwback anthems taking you back to the VH1 & MTV days" - loud shirts welcome. 
</p>
<h4>✪ SUNDAY ✪  </h4>
<p>After a big ol' street party there's nothing better than a giant roast and a little hair of the dog and that is exactly what you'll be getting, courtesty of the Vegan Food Pimp. 
Wind down the weekend with the last of the brewster beers available and toast the tastiness of these craftspeople's hard work, flavour skills and general knowse. Cheers!
					</p>



<p>
FEM.ALE’s platform has resonated further across the U.K, so much so that the

festival is an annual fixture in Brighton’s Marlborough Pub and Theatre. Erica added,

“People have been travelling from far and wide to be part of the movement. Taking

the show on the road to Brighton last year was a gamble, but one that paid off. It was

an incredible buzz to see FEM.ALE in full force in another city, far away from my

own”.
